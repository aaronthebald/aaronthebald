# Hello there 👋
My name is Aaron Wilson. I am a self-taught iOS Developer. I love building apps and solving problems! I have experience contributing to open-source projects, working as a contractor for the SaaS company [TrackHero](https://trackhero.com), and building personal projects. I am looking for a full-time position and would love to talk to you about joining your team! My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronwilsondev/), [My Resume](https://github.com/aaronthebald/aaronthebald/files/13814526/AaronWilsoniOSResume.pdf).  

## Professional and Open Source
My work at TrackHero has included taking the lead in building out the fleet management feature of the app. Views were built with SwiftUI and network requests were handled with Combine.

I contributed to the open-source Hacktoberfest project [Basic Car Maintenance](https://github.com/mikaelacaron/Basic-Car-Maintenance).

## Personal Projects
My Dog Days allows users to track events in the life of their dog. It is built  with SwiftUI and Core Data. Users are reminded of their events with local notifications. Available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/hu/app/my-dog-days/id6463662341). Check out the [Repo](https://github.com/aaronthebald/DogDays1)!

Cake allows users to browse recipes of popular desserts from [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com). Network requests were made with Async/Await, and unit tests were written using XCTest. Check out the [Repo](https://github.com/aaronthebald/Cake)
